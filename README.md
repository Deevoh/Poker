# Poker

Keeping in theme with casino games, I've created a poker game with scoring and betting. I might try and add additional mechanics or just leave it vanilla.


## **To Do**

- Check for invalid inputs.
- Implement scoring ratios based off bet and final hand, impacting balance in the end.
- Add ASCII cards?
- Possibly expand this with other casino betting games into an all-encompassing program with persistent betting across all?
